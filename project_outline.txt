A tool for Fire Emblem Pick My Unit challenges. 
We can start with functionality for a particular game (say, Fates Birthright) and add others as we go
Similarly, we can start with simply picking characters at random, and then add functionality as we go.

Planned features include:
A "Never picked" list for characters you don't want to be chosen (either because they're too good or bad)
An "Always available" list for, well, yeah. Like Lords or Dancers and such
Adjustable amount of units being picked, if you want to be constrained or free
Support for most or all games in the series
A "Pick My Pairings" mode for games where that's relevant
A "Pick My Classes" mode for games where that's relevant
A "Point-based" selection mode, where characters are weighted based on availability and viability
- The tool must then pick characters at random until the chosen point limit is reached
-Point values are adjustable, if a player doesn't think a given unit is THAT broken or terrible
A "Tier List-based" selection mode, where units are weighted based on their perceived quality for efficient play.
-Tier placements can be adjusted through an "Advanced" tab, and amount of units taken from each tier can also be chosen


This project may work better in Javascript than Django, so we might need to freshen up on that.
